# CRUD Specifications Policy
[[_TOC_]]

## Overview
specifications are divided into files according to the following principle:
* __external.yaml__ - provides services description for the external services or API
* __<module_name>.yaml__ - provides services description which belong to the Product

## Up-To-Date Support Policy
You can find on the [/arch-specs/docs/up_to_date.md](/arch-specs/docs/up_to_date.md) page 
a list of the events and your actions, which you should make upon the occurrence of each of them
to support Product documentation in up-to-date state.

## FAQ
### How can I validate my changes in specifications/* files locally?
You can use pipeline utility to validate specifications/* files. Please, use the next command to validate your changes:
```bash
cd ./service-hadbook
./pipeline.sh validate
```
_see more info in [readme.md#stage-validate](/README.md)_


### When should I change meta-information specifications/* files?
Please, see a list of actions in [/docs/up_to_date.md](/docs/up_to_date.md) 
that require you to make some changes to the `meta/specifications/*.yaml`  specifications.
